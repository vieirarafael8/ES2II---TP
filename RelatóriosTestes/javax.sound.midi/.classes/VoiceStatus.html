<i>28</i>&nbsp;/**
<i>29</i>&nbsp; * A {@code VoiceStatus} object contains information about the current status of
<i>30</i>&nbsp; * one of the voices produced by a {@link Synthesizer}.
<i>31</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
<i>32</i>&nbsp; * MIDI synthesizers are generally capable of producing some maximum number of
<i>33</i>&nbsp; * simultaneous notes, also referred to as voices. A voice is a stream of
<i>34</i>&nbsp; * successive single notes, and the process of assigning incoming MIDI notes to
<i>35</i>&nbsp; * specific voices is known as voice allocation. However, the voice-allocation
<i>36</i>&nbsp; * algorithm and the contents of each voice are normally internal to a MIDI
<i>37</i>&nbsp; * synthesizer and hidden from outside view. One can, of course, learn from MIDI
<i>38</i>&nbsp; * messages which notes the synthesizer is playing, and one might be able deduce
<i>39</i>&nbsp; * something about the assignment of notes to voices. But MIDI itself does not
<i>40</i>&nbsp; * provide a means to report which notes a synthesizer has assigned to which
<i>41</i>&nbsp; * voice, nor even to report how many voices the synthesizer is capable of
<i>42</i>&nbsp; * synthesizing.
<i>43</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
<i>44</i>&nbsp; * In Java Sound, however, a {@code Synthesizer} class can expose the contents
<i>45</i>&nbsp; * of its voices through its
<i>46</i>&nbsp; * {@link Synthesizer#getVoiceStatus() getVoiceStatus()} method. This behavior
<i>47</i>&nbsp; * is recommended but optional; synthesizers that don&#39;t expose their voice
<i>48</i>&nbsp; * allocation simply return a zero-length array. A {@code Synthesizer} that does
<i>49</i>&nbsp; * report its voice status should maintain this information at all times for all
<i>50</i>&nbsp; * of its voices, whether they are currently sounding or not. In other words, a
<i>51</i>&nbsp; * given type of {@code Synthesizer} always has a fixed number of voices, equal
<i>52</i>&nbsp; * to the maximum number of simultaneous notes it is capable of sounding.
<i>53</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
<i>54</i>&nbsp; * &lt;a id=&quot;description_of_active&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If the voice is not currently processing a
<i>55</i>&nbsp; * MIDI note, it is considered inactive. A voice is inactive when it has been
<i>56</i>&nbsp; * given no note-on commands, or when every note-on command received has been
<i>57</i>&nbsp; * terminated by a corresponding note-off (or by an &quot;all notes off&quot; message).
<i>58</i>&nbsp; * For example, this happens when a synthesizer capable of playing 16
<i>59</i>&nbsp; * simultaneous notes is told to play a four-note chord; only four voices are
<i>60</i>&nbsp; * active in this case (assuming no earlier notes are still playing). Usually, a
<i>61</i>&nbsp; * voice whose status is reported as active is producing audible sound, but this
<i>62</i>&nbsp; * is not always true; it depends on the details of the instrument (that is, the
<i>63</i>&nbsp; * synthesis algorithm) and how long the note has been going on. For example, a
<i>64</i>&nbsp; * voice may be synthesizing the sound of a single hand-clap. Because this sound
<i>65</i>&nbsp; * dies away so quickly, it may become inaudible before a note-off message is
<i>66</i>&nbsp; * received. In such a situation, the voice is still considered active even
<i>67</i>&nbsp; * though no sound is currently being produced.
<i>68</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
<i>69</i>&nbsp; * Besides its active or inactive status, the {@code VoiceStatus} class provides
<i>70</i>&nbsp; * fields that reveal the voice&#39;s current MIDI channel, bank and program number,
<i>71</i>&nbsp; * MIDI note number, and MIDI volume. All of these can change during the course
<i>72</i>&nbsp; * of a voice. While the voice is inactive, each of these fields has an
<i>73</i>&nbsp; * unspecified value, so you should check the active field first.
